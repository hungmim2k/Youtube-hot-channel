# Migration Summary

## Issue
The issue was that the Supabase database didn't have any tables created yet. The application was configured to use Supabase, but the necessary tables (`users` and `keywords`) hadn't been created.

## Solution
I've created a comprehensive solution to address this issue:

1. **SQL Script**: Created a `SUPABASE_TABLES.sql` file with the SQL statements needed to create the tables and the admin user.

2. **Migration Script**: Created a JavaScript migration script (`database/migrate.js`) that:
   - Loads environment variables from `.env.local`
   - Checks if the tables exist
   - Provides SQL statements to create the tables if they don't exist
   - Attempts to create the admin user

3. **Verification Script**: Created a verification script (`database/verify-tables.js`) that:
   - Checks if the `users` table exists and is accessible
   - Checks if the `keywords` table exists and is accessible
   - Verifies that the admin user exists with the correct credentials

4. **Instructions**: Created detailed instructions (`SUPABASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) on how to:
   - Set up the Supabase database
   - Run the SQL statements to create the tables
   - Verify that the setup was successful

5. **NPM Scripts**: Added scripts to `package.json` to make it easy to:
   - Run the migration script: `npm run migrate:js`
   - Verify the tables: `npm run verify-tables`

## Admin Account
The admin account is created with the following credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `0968885430`

## Next Steps
1. Follow the instructions in `SUPABASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to create the tables in Supabase
2. Run `npm run verify-tables` to confirm that the tables have been created successfully
3. Start the application and log in with the admin credentials

## Technical Details
The application uses Supabase as its database provider. The necessary environment variables are:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

These variables should be set in the `.env.local` file.
